- 2024-2025: Working on Search Quality at Exa - goal: make an independent general search engine that's better than Google for AI Agents.
  - September 2024: (first attempt at general search) Implemented Keyword+Embeddings search in Exa's vector database. This allowed Exa to handle a new class of queries (keyword ones) and generally improved recall. This involved reading lots of papers about Sparse Embeddings Retrieval, developing automated search engine evaluations, experimeting with hybrid search approaches, then implementing and optimizing a billion-scale keyword search engine.
  - 2025-Now: (second attempt at general search) Collected the relevant portion of the web. This was an index expansion effort where I tried to figure out how to get the best set of documents on the Web, and then worked on developing the index infrastructure needed to continuously collect and serve these documents. Scaled our crawling from 500 pages per second to 50k pages to second.
