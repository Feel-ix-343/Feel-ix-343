Programming for dopamine.

### what I've worked on

- ~2021: Projects regarding algorithmic crypto trading (using tradingview pinescript)
  - [Harmonic Pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/harmonic-patterns-in-the-currency-markets.asp) technical analysis screener with on-chart buy and sell targets: https://www.tradingview.com/script/LzFt8cCN-Harmonic-Indicator/. It has become popular on trading view over the past 4 years.
- 2021-~2023: learningtocode; python -> scala -> typescript -> rust; functional programming; arch linux etc. I made a few non-trivial projects ([obsidian canvas moc](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/obsidian-canvas-moc), [web nav](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/Web_Nav), [omnis](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/Omnis)), contributed to [lichess in scala](https://lichess.org/) + [zed.dev](https://zed.dev/), and built an remodeling estimating system for my dad (which is still in prod unfortunately)
- 2023-2024: Building [Markdown-Oxide](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide), a markdown-based knowledge management backend for any text editor. Markdown-oxide became the second most popular open-source markdown language server, has 80k+ downloads, and 17+ contributors.
- 2024-2025: Developing general informational search at [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai/) in San Francisco - objective: build extremely high precision informational web search, independent of google/bing, and give it to LLMs as an enterprise-ready API (with ZDR and such)
  - September 2024-Jan 2025: Developed a billion-scale Keyword+Embeddings search engine in Exa's vector database. This allowed Exa to handle an new, important class of queries (highly specific keyword ones) and generally improved recall. This is *Exa Hybrid Search*
  - Jan 2025-June 2025: Did web index research + developed crawling infrastructure to expand the Exa index to the full *relevant portion of the web* (billions++). After this, Exa started to beat Google on some general search eval sets.
