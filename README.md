Programming for dopamine.

### what I've worked on

- ~2021: Projects regarding algorithmic crypto trading (using tradingview pinescript)
  - [Harmonic Pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/harmonic-patterns-in-the-currency-markets.asp) technical analysis screener with on-chart buy and sell targets: https://www.tradingview.com/script/LzFt8cCN-Harmonic-Indicator/. It has become popular on trading view over the past 4 years.
- 2021-2023: I made a few non-trivial projects ([obsidian canvas moc](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/obsidian-canvas-moc), [web nav](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/Web_Nav), [omnis](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/Omnis)), contributed to [lichess in scala](https://lichess.org/) + [zed.dev in rust](https://zed.dev/), and built an construction estimating system for my dad (which is still in prod unfortunately)
- 2023-2024: Built the second most popular markdown language server, [Markdown-Oxide](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide). Markdown-oxide is an obsidian-style knowledge management backend for any text editor.
- 2024-2025: Developing an informational web search engine/API at [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai/) in San Francisco
  - September 2024-Jan 2025: R&D + infra eng for a billion-scale Hybrid Search engine (Keyword+Embeddings)
  - Jan 2025-June 2025: R&D + infra eng to collect and serve the *relevant portion of the web*
